# Manafia-Factions
A new factions experience.

## About



We've optimized nearly every single class with performance in mind. We have fully stress-tested the entire plugin. In some cases, this plugin saves 1.8MB of RAM per player, starts up 200% faster and with the proper configuration, it can claim 1 million chunks in just 20 seconds! These results will vary depending on hardware.

What is different?
Fully re-polished the entire plugin
Faction Shields basic functionality
Faction Boosters
More configuration
Condensed YML files
Removed discord functionality as it was poorly optimized and ran on the main thread




Power Booster - Increase the power boost in your faction.

Exp Booster - Increase mob exp drops in your territory.

MobDrops Booster - Increase mob drops in your territory.

MobSpawn Booster - Increase mob spawn in your territory.

## For the future

In future releases, we hope to add KOTH, duels, conquest and more. This would require a lot of time and effort, so any help is appreciated especially considering this would all be free and open-source.
